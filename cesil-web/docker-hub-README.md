# CESIL

CESIL (Computer Education in Schools Instruction Language) was developed by ICL to be used to teach computer programming in UK secondary schools.

This is an attempt to create a web based interpreter for the langauge. The web application has been developed in Kotlin and the project can be found on GitHub at [https://github.com/cmh-dev/cesil](https://github.com/cmh-dev/cesil).

### Usage

To run the interpreter enter:

`docker run -d -p 8080:8080 cmhdev/cesil`

The web application will then be available on http://localhost:8080
