# CESIL

CESIL (Computer Education in Schools Instruction Language) was developed by ICL to be used to teach computer programming in UK secondary schools.

This is an attempt to create a web based interpreter for the language.

### Usage

To run the interpreter enter:

`docker run -d -p 8080:8080 cmhdev/cesil`

The web application will then be available on http://localhost:8080
